Welcome to FIRM3D's documentation!
==================================

FIRM3D (Fast Ion Reduced Models in 3D) is a software suite for modeling of energetic particle dynamics in 3D magnetic fields. The guiding center equations of motion are integrated in magnetic fields represented in Boozer coordinates, including VMEC equilibria and Alfv√©n eigenmodes from AE3D or FAR3D.

The core routines are based on `SIMSOPT <https://simsopt.readthedocs.io>`_, but have been extended to include additional physics and diagnostics that are not typically required in the optimization context. This standalone framework enables more modular development of FIRM3D with minimal dependencies.
