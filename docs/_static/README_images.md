# Image Instructions

## Adding the 3D Magnetic Field Visualization

To complete the front page setup, please add your 3D magnetic field visualization image:

1. **Save the image** as `boozer_field_visualization.png` in this directory (`docs/_static/`)
2. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Format: PNG (for transparency support)
   - Size: 600px width (height will scale proportionally)
   - Resolution: 72-150 DPI for web display
   - Background: White or transparent (to match documentation theme)

## Image Description
The image should show:
- A complex twisted toroidal magnetic field configuration
- Field lines or trajectories on the surface
- Green particle markers showing positions along orbits
- 3D perspective view emphasizing the twisted geometry
- Clean, scientific visualization style

## Alternative Names
If you prefer a different filename, update these files:
- `docs/index.rst` - Update the figure path
- `docs/conf.py` - Update the logo path

The image will appear both as the main illustration on the front page and as the logo in the sidebar.
