This example traces 5000 particles in the Wistell-A configuration scaled to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. 
Particles are initialized on the s=0.3 surface, with positions chosen proportional to the voluem element. 
Particles are traced until they reach the boundary (s=1) or the elapsed time is 1e-2 seconds. 

On perlmutter (06.14.25), the wallclock time is about 89 seconds using the attached slurm script.
