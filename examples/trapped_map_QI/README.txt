This example computes the trapped particle Poincare map in the nfp = 3 vacuum QI configuration of A. Goodman. 

Goodman, Alan G., et al. "Constructing precisely quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields." Journal of Plasma Physics 89.5 (2023): 905890504.

The particle is assumed to mirror at (s,theta,zeta)=(0.5,0,pi/6) with the alpha particle birth energy.
