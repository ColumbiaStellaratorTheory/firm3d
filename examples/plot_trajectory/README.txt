This example traces 1 trapped particle in the Wistell-A configuration scaled to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. 
The particle is traced for 1e-4 seconds, with data saved at time intervals of 1e-7 s. 

On perlmutter (06.14.25), the wallclock time is about 33 seconds using the attached slurm script.
