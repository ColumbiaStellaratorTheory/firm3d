This example traces 5000 particles in the Wistell-A configuration scaled to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. Particles are initialized uniformly  wrt the volume element and traced until they reach the boundary (s=1) or the elapsed time is 1e-2 seconds. 

On perlmutter (06.11.25), the wallclock time is about 84 seconds using the attached slurm script.
