This example computes the passing particle Poincare map in the Wistell-A configuration scaled 
to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. Co-passing alpha particles (mu = 0, sign(v_{\|}) = +1) with 
the alpha particle birth energy are assumed. 

On perlmutter (06.17.25), the wallclock time is about 30 seconds using the attached slurm script. 
On macOS (06.17.25), the wallclock time is about 3.5 minutes, running with the command "mpiexec -n 8 python passing_map.py"
