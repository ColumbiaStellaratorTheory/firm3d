This example computes the passing particle frequencies in the Wistell-A configuration scaled 
to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. Co-passing alpha particles (mu = 0, sign(v_{\|}) = +1) with 
the alpha particle birth energy are assumed. This calculation informs the resonances and islands observed 
in the passing Poincare map. In the limit of small energy, the ratio of characteristic transit frequencies, 
omega_theta/\omega_zeta, should match the iota profile for mu = 0.
